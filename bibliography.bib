  abstract  = "Even with specialized trauma systems, a significant number of
deaths occur within the early postinjury period. Our goal was to
examine deaths within this period for cause and determine if
care could improve outcomes. A retrospective chart review was
performed on all patients who were dead on arrival or died
within 4 hours of arrival between January 1, 2005, and December
31, 2011. Survival probabilities and Injury Severity Score (ISS)
were calculated. Chart review and trauma review processes were
used to determine cases with opportunities for care improvement.
Two hundred eighty-nine patients were dead on arrival (DOA), and
176 patients died within 4 hours of arrival. The most common
mechanism of injury was gunshot wounds (68.4\%). The most common
causes of death were uncontrolled hemorrhage (68.2\%) and
neurologic trauma (23.4\%). Average ISS was 32. Twenty-nine
patients had survival probability percentages over 50. Ten of
176 (5.7\%) deaths were found to have opportunities for care
improvement. In three cases (1.7\%), errors contributed to
death. The majority of trauma patients DOA or dying within 4
hours of hospital arrival have nonsurvivable injuries. Regular
trauma review processes are invaluable in determining
opportunities for care improvement. Autopsy information
increases the reliability of the review process.",
